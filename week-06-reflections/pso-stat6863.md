[Chapter 4, Question 1] 
* Question (pso-stat6863): Can you force a union even though both datasets do not have the same number of columns?

[Chapter 4, Question 2] 
* Question (pso-stat6863): Why wouldnâ€™t outer union all work?

[Chapter 4, Question 3] 
* Question (pso-stat6863): Is there a way to union two datasets without using two select statements (e.g. select * from data1 union from data2)?

[Chapter 4, Question 4] 
* Question (pso-stat6863): Can a full join substitute a union operator (i.e. can a full join produce the same results as a union)?

[Chapter 4, Question 5] 
* Question (pso-stat6863): Can you use all as a set operator?

* Question (pso-stat6863): Is there a way to name the set datasets instead of using the full dataset name?

[adv_recipe_for_combining_data_vertically recipe] 
* Question (pso-stat6863): Are parentheses necessary for union all corr?
